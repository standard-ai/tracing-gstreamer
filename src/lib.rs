// This crate interacts directly with the C API of glib, gobject and gstreamer libraries. As a
// result implementation of this crate uses unsafe code quite liberally.
//
// Originally the motivation to introduce the unsafe code was to reduce the build times and avoid
// the fairly heavy dependencies introduced by the `gstreamer` crate. However, since then we
// introduced `gstreamer` back in order to implement some `GstElement`s to generate spans from
// wrapped elements.
//
// We continue to use the unsafe code for hooking into the log subsystem however, for it avoids a
// non-free layer of abstraction (allocations for the closure, for instance).
//
// Additionally, it makes it easier to cross-check for soundness issues in the upstream library,
// such as https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs/-/issues/352
